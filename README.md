Open Assets On SQL Dashboard view Grid Click


SQL dashboards allow you to create grids of data from any SQL data source. However, when you click on that item to open it, it will open up the default search page for that item instead of actually opening up the asset. This now allows you to open up any asset, CI, or KB in a new tab.
